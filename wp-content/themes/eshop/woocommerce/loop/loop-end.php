/**
* Product Loop End
*
* This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/loop/loop-end.php.
*
* HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
* (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
* maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
* happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
* the readme will list any important changes.
*
		* @see 	    https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/
		* @package 	WooCommerce/Templates
* @version     2.0.0
